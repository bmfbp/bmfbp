* status
** got reuse working in cl-event-passing
** (some days ago) built PEG parser part in bmfbp/clparts
** try to reuse PEG parser part to build JSON parser
** working on bmfbp/build-process/cl-build/convert.lisp
** check that bmfbp/clparts/parser-builder works

* todo
** cut loops over to bmfbp
** cut cl-event-passing over to bmfbp
** should @defnetwork macro use the last declaration as the top level?

** fixed: why is (pbuilder :souce-out) not erroring out?  It's a typo.

* git branches
** master
** pt-20191129-json - build json parser using PEG parser builder part in bmfbp/clparts
   no Spacing in test.peg --> first test is to remove all whitespace, when that works, we'll add Spacing rules

* git kraken
** merge, drag one branch and drop it onto another
