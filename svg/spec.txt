convert <g transform="translate(0.5,0.5)"> to Lisp, e.g. (translate (0.5 0.5)

All SVG transform lines become new Lisp lists (translate (x y) ...).

All <path d="M ...> forms become Lisp line forms (line 'absm ...).

<text ... /text> become Lisp forms (text x y "THETEXT")

SVG drawing conventions: all paths represent simple line segements where the coordinates are translated into 'absl or 'rell (if we have any of these).  Discard all fill / stroke / etc.  The convention is that we draw everything in black and white.  Paths with Z will represent arrowheads by convention.  It would be nice to have the parser (or a pass before it) type-check that the conventions are held - no colors, etc.
