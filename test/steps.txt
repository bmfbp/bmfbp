0. cd bmfbp/test
1. open ../build_process/build_process.drawio
2. select tab ide.svg
3. mouse select (marquee) all boxes on ide.svg
4. file>>export as>>svg>>selection only EXPORT as ../build_process/ide.svg (replace)
5. cd bmfbp/test
6. ./run >>>> complains about "BAD svg"
7. back to Draw.IO, FILE>>Open ../build_process/ide.svg
8. click on rounded rectangle, select TEXT, deselect Word-wrap and Formatted-text
9. apple-S to save back to ide.svg
10. ./run
11. crashes into SBCL (type "(exit)")
12. open temp1.lisp in editor
13. search for "build process" - it is there 3 times, once in meta, twice in TRANSLATE

-- what is confusing my compiler is :
...

(rect 842.0 0.0 80.0 80.0) 
 (translate 
  (846.5 33.5) 
  (
   ("build process" 
    (translate 
     (35.0 12.0) 
     ("build process"))))) 

...

-- that is where the problems are -- there are no "Not supported" things in the .svg, but, "build process" is there twice at two different coords (cummulative) --

-- I might be able to catch the (translate (x y) (("build process" (translate (a b) "build process" .... in Lisp if it is a pattern...

-- (ignore, as this just goes further into the weeds)... I go on from here and deselect Word-wrap on every string, then get into trouble with the compiler - it complains that a box has two partKinds ("build process" and "build process", which appears as two different strings).
