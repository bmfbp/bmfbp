All Parts are concurrent, hence, the editor can be built piece-meal and snapped together.

Pieces:

- Renderer - renders graphic atoms onto screen (browser?) from a display list and/or factbase, e.g. straight line segments, curved line segments, text, ellipses, (rects?  - can be built with straight line segments), rounded rects, cursor, mark, "transients" (some kind of representation of objects that have been selected), highlighting (indication), mouse

- Factbase - to hold the graphic atoms (?), including groups of graphic objects

- mouse gesture tracker ; mouse-move (by various increments)

- keyboard tracker & keybinding

- "control" tracker (often referred to as "graphic handles" ; to change a Bezier curve)

- hit-stack controller - add/remove objects from hit-stack, provide top of hit-stack, roll hit-stack


- buffers - allow editing of multiple diagrams simultaneously - show buffers, switch buffer, new/open/close buffer

- build - compile a buffer, compile all buffers

- error viewer/buffer

- status line(s)

- menu system

- views - show a buffer on-screen

- grid - set-size, provide closest coordinate as a function of a given coordinate

- text editor - in-place editing is most convenient, else pop-up text editor ; edit/save/new text item ; set foreground/background colour, size, font, bold/italic/underline/overstrike, text-anchor etc.

- graphic object attributes - foreground/background colours, line-width

- arrowheads

- macros - normalize selected graphic object, save/restore

- operators - to manipulate graphic atoms (all accessible from keyboard / menu, may be bound to mouse gestures)
-- show/hide controls and nodes (a "node" is a natural endpoint of some graphic element, e.g. two ends of a line, bounding box of a textbox, etc. ; a "control" is an artificial handle that provides manipulation of graphic elements, e.g. handles that control the curvature of a Bezier curve).
-- group/ungroup/resize all selected items
-- add item(s) to selection list
-- resize NESW (north/east/south/west), expand/shrink group/item uniformly in all directions
-- create/follow link into new/existing buffer
-- copy/del/paste selected
-- move selected: to mark, to cursor
-- move viewport view (panning, scrolling, zooming)
-- select at cursor including all objects connected to selected item (eg. select all nodes of a line, then move the selected items (nodes))

- transients ; create/make-invisible/move (separate FB for convenience?) 

- region/marquee/rubber-band tracker

- search

- print - convert to pdf(?) and print (save then print?)
