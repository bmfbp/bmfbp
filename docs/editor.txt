All Parts are concurrent, hence, the editor can be built piece-meal and snapped together.

Pieces:

- Renderer - renders graphic atoms onto screen (browser?) from a display list and/or factbase, e.g. straight line segments, curved line segments, text, ellipses, (rects?  - can be built with straight line segments), rounded rects, cursor, mark, "transients" (some kind of representation of objects that have been selected), highlighting (indication), mouse

- Factbase - to hold the graphic atoms (?), including groups of graphic objects

- mouse tracker

- keyboard tracker

- "control" tracker (often referred to as "graphic handles" ; to change a Bezier curve)

- hit-stack controller - add/remove objects from hit-stack, return (handle to) top of hit-stack, roll hit-stack

- operators - to manipulate graphic atoms:

-- show/hide controls and nodes 
-- group/ungroup all selected items
-- add item to selection list
--
