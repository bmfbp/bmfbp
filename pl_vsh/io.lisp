;; read facts from stdin, determine ownership of ports, output net (for semantic checking and coding)

;; the factbase is a hash table of hash tables
;; the root hashtable contains id's of every node and edge in the drawing
;; each id contains a hashtable of facts (lists of pairs and triples) pertaining to the id
;; much like the fields of a class or struct, but more flexible - e.g. at this point, I haven't
;; sussed out how to keep command line options, etc., but can add them in the future simply by
;; scanning new facts and storing them in the id-based hash tables
;; futhermore, the parser and semantic passes can add new facts into the factbase as
;; new information about the drawing nodes is inferred
