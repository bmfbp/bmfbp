See Diagram-Compiler-As-A-Compilable-Diagram.jpg first.

This is the first release, 0.1, of vsh (visual shell) and grash (graph
shell).

Presently, the code is in "alpha" / toy state, but is intended to
inspire and demonstrate some simple concepts for building FBP-like
(flow-based programming) visual tools using components implemented in
various languages.

This examplar implementation runs on linux and implements a (very)
simple replacement for "sh" that uses diagrams to represent
combinations of commands and pipes, based on the notions of FBP.
These ideas should be easily transcribeable onto other operating
systems. 

Concepts that may be of interest:

- implement FBP on top of linux, in place of bash and friends

- a multi-lingual FBP

- a trivial (250 lines of C) "graph" shell that could be used with
  other implementations of FBP to spawn concurrent components and
  plumb them together

- a simple technique for compiling diagrams to code

- use of an off-the-shelf diagram tool to produce compilable code

- the concept of factbases

- obvious future extensions to add sockets, named pipes, etc., as flow
  carriers
